"""Yeast ToolKit and Pichia ToolKit sequences registry.

Yeast ToolKit:
    Sequences were obtained from two different AddGene sources:
    * The YTK plasmid files distributed with the kit in a zip archive,
      available under the *Protocol & Resources* tab of the YTK repository.
    * The individual plasmid files from their dedicated AddGene webpages,
      using the *full depositor* sequences.

    Records were then merged using a Python script and ``biopython``; details
    can be found in the history of the ``git`` repository. Some annotations
    were also added to common genes and sequences (such as the Chloramphenicol
    resistance cassette `CmR <https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P62577>`_, or
    the `H4 ARS consensus <https://www.yeastgenome.org/locus/ARS209>`_).
    Duplicated features refering to the same location were merged directly,
    and duplicated features with unidentical locations were manually reviewed.

Pichia ToolKit:
    Sequences were obtained from two different AddGene sources:
    * The PTK plasmid files available on each AddGene plasmid webpage as
      *Supplemental Documents*
    * The indiviual plasmid files from their dedicated AddGene webpages,
      using the *full AddGene* sequences.

    Since both sequences did not share the same origins, plasmids were rotated
    for the upstream *BsaI* recognition site to span on nucleotides 3 to 11,
    in order for the PTK plasmids to be organized like the YTK plasmids. Using
    ``biopython``, sequences were annotated using a custom annotation script
    (see `source <https://github.com/althonos/moclo/blob/master/scripts>_`).
